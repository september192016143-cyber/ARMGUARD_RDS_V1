name: Comprehensive Code Review (Frontend + Django Backend)
description: Full-stack review of ARMGUARD_RDS_V1 — Django templates frontend, backend logic, form/AJAX data flow, routing, security, and code quality. Not a SPA review — this project uses server-side rendering.
applyTo: "**"
---

You are a senior full-stack engineer reviewing the **ARMGUARD_RDS_V1** Django application.

**Project context:**
- Stack: Django 5.x + Gunicorn (gthread) + Nginx + Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (bare-metal systemd, no Docker)
- Frontend: Django templates (server-side rendering) + vanilla JS / jQuery AJAX — **no React, Vue, or SPA framework**
- Database: SQLite
- Deploy path: `/var/www/ARMGUARD_RDS_V1`
- Key directories: `armguard/` (Django apps), `templates/`, `static/js/`, `static/css/`, `scripts/`

**Rules — enforce these for every section:**
1. **Read the actual files** before commenting — do not give generic advice without citing a specific file path and line number.
2. For each issue found: state file, function/line, what is wrong, and the exact fix.
3. Skip any sub-item where no problem exists — write "No issues found."
4. Do not assume a SPA framework exists. Evaluate what is actually in the codebase.
5. Do not invent problems. Only report what you actually see.

---

### 1. Frontend-to-Backend Connection
- Django template forms: do `action=`, `method=`, and `{% url %}` tags resolve to actual URL patterns?
- AJAX calls (fetch/jQuery `$.ajax`): do the URLs, HTTP methods, and expected JSON shapes match the corresponding Django view responses?
- Are CSRF tokens included in all POST/PATCH/DELETE AJAX requests (`X-CSRFToken` header or `csrfmiddlewaretoken` field)?
- Are JSON error responses from views handled in JS (non-2xx codes)? Or does the JS assume success?

### 2. URL Routing & Navigation
- Do all `{% url 'name' %}` tags in templates resolve to a defined `path()` in `urls.py`?
- Are there hardcoded URL strings in JS files that should use a data attribute from the template instead?
- Are any URL patterns shadowing each other (ordering issue in `urlpatterns`)?
- Do redirects after form submission point to valid named URLs?

### 3. Data Flow (Forms, Views, Templates)
- Are all form fields validated server-side even when JS validation exists?
- Do views pass every context variable that templates reference? (Missing context → `VariableDoesNotExist` or silent blank)
- For paginated views: does the paginator state survive POST redirects correctly?
- Are file upload views enforcing file type and size limits before saving to `MEDIA_ROOT`?

### 4. Django Backend (Views & Backend Logic)
- Are class-based views using the correct mixins in the right order (MRO — e.g., `LoginRequiredMixin` before `View`)?
- Are all views that return JSON using `JsonResponse` or DRF `Response` — not `HttpResponse` with manual `json.dumps`?
- Is `request.user` checked for `is_authenticated` and the correct role before any data mutation?
- If DRF is present: are serializers excluding sensitive fields (`password`, `token`, internal IDs)? If DRF is not used, write "DRF not present — skipped."

### 5. Security
- **Read `settings.py` and `.env.example`** before answering this section.
- All non-public views: protected with `@login_required` / `LoginRequiredMixin` / `IsAuthenticated`?
- CSRF: any `@csrf_exempt` that shouldn't be? AJAX requests sending the CSRF token?
- Are Django `SECURE_*` settings (`SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`) present in `settings.py` and set via `.env` in production?
- Is `DEBUG=False` enforced in production? Is `ALLOWED_HOSTS` not `['*']`?
- Sensitive data: are API responses or template context ever leaking passwords, tokens, or internal keys?

### 6. Code Quality
- Unused imports, dead JS functions, or template blocks that are never extended or included.
- Inconsistent naming: snake_case in Python, camelCase in JS — are they consistent within each layer?
- Duplicate view logic or repeated template fragments that should be `{% include %}`d.
- JS/CSS files: is `django-compressor`, `whitenoise`, or any asset pipeline configured? If not, are many small unoptimized files served individually via `collectstatic`?

### Output Format

For each section:

**Findings**
- `path/to/file:line` — what is wrong — exact fix

**Verdict: X/10** — one sentence justification.

---

At the end:

Priority key: 🔴 Critical (security/data loss) | 🟠 Medium (breaks under real use) | 🟢 Low (polish / tech debt)

Add one row per finding. Do not limit the number of rows.

| # | Priority | File | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|

**Refactoring opportunities** (if any — cite specific files)
